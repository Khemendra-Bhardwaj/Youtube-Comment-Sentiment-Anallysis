"Learn and deepen your understanding of the *OSHO Active Meditations* with a LIVE ONLINE COURSE: https://booking.osho.com/monthly/osho-meditation-in-depth/
Osho calls meditation the science for the transformation of life and stresses the importance of getting the techniques right, saying: _“Each technique is for bringing about a revolution in you. First try to understand the technique absolutely rightly.”_ Based on extensive guidance from Osho, this course has been *developed by OSHO International,* to ensure that you have all the information you need to get the full benefit of each meditation. The emphasis is on gaining a deep experiential understanding of how they work. *_The only prerequisite_* is an interest in the OSHO meditations.",4

"Was Osho for polygamy, one world government, the end of all religions, vegetarianism, against marriage and the family, for the end of all politics? No...only for awareness/meditation...going within now, then stuff just happens spontaneously...afraid your destiny is not ""death"" but the end of ""I AM""...all is doomed to flower as a Buddha, resistance is futile....you are enlightened herenow! 🤣🙃🤪",2

"Please don't identify with mind...           U are not the mind... The mind is only a useful as a ""Tool"" only for us to complete our daily chores. We have to learn to live above the mind.              The mind is a liken to a secretary who will never allow you to meet the ""Boss"". Hah. As long as U think U are the mind...Yes.! The mind is a gift from ""God""... Hahaa... but use it well.       But never try to shackle or to stop the mind it will rebel and destroy U.      Love the mind, as the mind doesn't know anything about Love. That it is soo important that we need to get intouch with mind so as let it meet the heart...that is a tru Sadhna... A tru spirit path. A path to enlightenment and through meditation it will be a path to enlightenment...In otherwords U cannot be more than what U are.            Quoted from George Gurdrieff...            I am only real, when I am...U don't really have actually learn to meditate. As what ever is seen is a Meditation. We are just not aware of it...If we therefore take the veil from our eyes we will just have to realize this. As St. Francis of Assisi once said, ""He that is looking is what is seeing""... Once again U can't be more than what U are... As everything else becomes Irrelevant. Our ultimate goal is to become the...................
